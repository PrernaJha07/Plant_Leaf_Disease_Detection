Plant leaf Disease Detection
This project is a web application for detecting diseases in plant leaves using a trained deep learning model. Users can register and login to upload images of plant leaves and get a prediction of the disease along with suggested cure measures. The system also identifies if the uploaded image is not a plant leaf.

Features
-User registration and login system

-Upload images of plant leaves for disease detection

-Detect multiple plant diseases and provide cure suggestions

-Classify images as plant diseases or no plant

-Responsive and user-friendly interface

-Image upload preview and prediction display

-Built with Flask and TensorFlow

-Model trained on PlantVillage dataset including a no_plant category

Installation
-Clone the repository

-Create a virtual environment and activate it

-Install required packages from requirements.txt

-Run the Flask app

Usage
-Register a new user or login with existing credentials

-Upload a plant leaf image and click proceed

-View the predicted disease and cure measures

Logout when done

Dataset
The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset with an additional class for non-plant images

Dataset is not included in the repository due to size limitations

Notes
-Make sure to have Python 3.8 or higher installed

-Use the virtual environment to avoid package conflicts

-To retrain the model, use the provided training scripts with the appropriate dataset folder structure
